## GIS&T Course (ISTE 740) Weekly Activities @ RIT
This repositiory contains weekly activites performed for the Geographic Information Sciences and Technologies course @ Rochester Institute of Technology, New York. The professor for this course was Dr. Brian Tomaszewski

Following are some highlights of the weekly activities performed in the course. To understand what to expect from the course you can have a look at the activities themselves provided in the repository week wise. 

### Week 1
#### A case study on maps and representation techniques. Example maps I chose to use.
